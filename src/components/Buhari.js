                        Muhammadu Buhari served as Nigeria’s president from May 29, 2015, to May 29, 2023. Before his democratic presidency, Buhari had ruled Nigeria as a military head of state from 1983 to 1985 following a coup. His 2015 election victory marked the first time in Nigeria’s history that an incumbent president was defeated, a major milestone for the country’s democracy.

                        During his presidency, Buhari prioritized fighting corruption, strengthening national security, and addressing economic challenges. His administration launched the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) in 2017 to revitalize the Nigerian economy and reduce dependence on oil. Buhari also implemented significant anti-corruption efforts, though his government faced criticism over human rights issues and economic struggles, including rising unemployment and inflation.
