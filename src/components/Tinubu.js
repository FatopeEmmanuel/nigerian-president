                    Bola Ahmed Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos State and influential political figure, became Nigeria's president on May 29, 2023. Before his presidency, Tinubu was known as the "Jagaban" for his significant role in shaping the political landscape of Nigeria, particularly through his leadership in the formation of the All Progressives Congress (APC). His tenure as Lagos State governor from 1999 to 2007 saw transformative policies that modernized Lagos, making it a hub of commerce and development.

                    As president, Tinubu's administration focused on economic reforms, aiming to tackle inflation, boost foreign investment, and stabilize the nation's energy sector. He initiated subsidy removal on fuel, a significant but controversial decision that sparked both praise and protests. Tinubu also advocated for strengthening Nigeriaâ€™s democratic institutions and promoting security reforms to address terrorism and banditry.
