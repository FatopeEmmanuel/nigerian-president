                    Goodluck Jonathan served as Nigeria’s president from 2010 to 2015. He initially became president in 2010 following the death of President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua, having served as vice president from 2007. Jonathan's rise from a humble background in Bayelsa State to Nigeria’s highest office was seen as a story of unexpected political fortune.

During his presidency, Jonathan focused on economic reforms, infrastructure development, and electoral transparency. His administration launched the Transformation Agenda, aimed at diversifying the economy, boosting power generation, and improving agriculture and education. Notably, his government privatized the power sector in hopes of resolving Nigeria’s electricity challenges.

However, Jonathan’s tenure was marred by rising insecurity, particularly with the escalation of Boko Haram insurgency in the Northeast and the kidnapping of the Chibok schoolgirls in 2014, which drew international attention. Despite these challenges, he earned global praise for his statesmanship in 2015 when he peacefully conceded defeat to Muhammadu Buhari, marking a critical moment for Nigeria’s democracy.
